PocketWordle
============

I thought this morning... "You know what would be ridiculous? Recreating Wordle on some random platform."

Back when 2048 was the New Hotnessâ„¢, I threw together a Game Boy Advance version of it for fun. So, I could throw Wordle onto a game console... but why not throw it onto something with an actual keyboard?

Here is PocketWordle for Pocket PC 2003, built using Visual Studio 2005 and MFC.

## Not implemented:

- Settings (light mode, dark mode, colour-blind mode)
- Statistics
- Daily words
- Virtual keyboard that displays which letters you know information about

I'm unlikely to implement the missing features - I just wanted to have a bit of fun and recreate the core Wordle experience for laughs.
